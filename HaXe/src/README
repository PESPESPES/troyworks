HaXe:


callback is a special function that creates a closure at compile time

a private var in Haxe is the equivalent of a protected var in as3

haxe can be very picky about types, in switches in particular, if you are mixing States and Functions, set a var rather than return a switch.

a class function without public/private is assumed to be private in a class and public in an interface

If you have an optional var typed haxe.PosInfos in a function, and you do not pass anything, the copiler will insert the callsite

I have assumed the when the last transitionLog entry is a particular state, then the machine is in that state.
